						<h2>About ILO</h2>
					</header>

					<p>
					The philosophy behind ILO is centred around thoughtful feature design. The tools we use inform the things we create with them. It's important that we pick the right tool for the job and that we understand what paradigms those tool are imposing on us. ILO takes a cue stack approach to show control. This isn't the only way to structure a live performance, but it's a great place to learn about the world of existing theatre technology.
					</p>
					<p>
					You may have noticed that ILO has far fewer features than other show control options. This is because ILO is designed for the performance creator who is just starting out or who wants to keep the content front and centre. ILO is light weight and simple so that as you use it you'll understand everything that's happening at all times.
					</p>
					<p>
					ILO isn't right for every project. ILO works great for small productions, but as your projects grow in ambition you may grow out of the scope of ILO's limited feature set. That's OK. ILO was designed as a stepping stone, not the be all end all of show control. Hopeful what you've learned using ILO will remain reliant as you move forward.
					</P>
					<P>
					This software is still in alpha so please use it at with the expectation that things might break or not work as expected. At this stage it is not recommended to use the software for any show with a "real" audience. If you find a bug, or have any feedback we'd love to hear about it.
